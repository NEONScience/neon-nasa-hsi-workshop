title: "Comparing NEON and NASA Airborne Campaigns and Datasets"
---

While NASA and NEON operate similar imaging spectrometer instruments, there are a number of differences between the two in terms of the goals driving the airborne campaigns as well as the datasets provided. This section provides a high-level overview of some of the similarities and differences between the two. @tbl-nasa_neon_comparison shows some of the differences in terms of the major questions (when, where, why) about the two missions.

## Data Processing

### Data products
NEON data are processed to Level 2 (flightline) and Level 3 (tiled mosaic) data products, and include a number of derived data products such as vegetation and water indices, LAI, fPAR, and Albedo. NASA data are processed to Level 1 (flightline) radiance. 

### Atmospheric correction:
NEON uses ATCOR-4 for the atmospheric correction. NASA uses ISOFIT ...


## Data Storage and Access

### NEON

NEON data are stored on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and are accessible via the [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org/). A subset of the L3 data products are also available on [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/publisher/neon-prod-earthengine).

NEON provides an API for downloading from the Data Portal, and has developed tools in R ([neonUtilities](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neonUtilities/index.html)) and Python ([neonutilities](https://pypi.org/project/neonutilities/)) for downloading NEON data, and wrangling OS and IS data.

### NASA

NASA airborne data are stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and can be accessed through the [ORNL DAAC](https://daac.ornl.gov/). NASA provides tools including Earthdata Search to help data users discover and download datasets.

This workshop will provide more details on accessing NEON and NASA airborne datasets in the [Python Notebooks](../notebooks) section.
