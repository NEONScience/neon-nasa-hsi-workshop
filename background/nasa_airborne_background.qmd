# NASA Airborne Data

NASA has operated several airborne remote sensing platforms, summarized below. For the sake of this workshop, we will be focusing on the AVIRIS sensors, which are the same family the NEON Imaging Spectrometers (NIS), which are AVIRIS-NG sensors.

# AVIRIS
![](../img/aviris.png)

The Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer - Classic ([AVIRIS-C](https://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/)), Next Generation ([AVIRIS-NG](https://avirisng.jpl.nasa.gov/)), and 3rd Generation (AVIRIS-3) are three Facility Instruments (FIs) that are part of NASA's Airborne Science Program (ASP) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Earth Science Airborne Program. 

Data from AVIRIS-C, AVIRIS-NG, and AVIRIS-3 are applicable to a wide range of studies in the fields of terrestrial and coastal aquatic plant physiology, atmospheric and aerosol studies, environmental science, snow hydrology, geology, volcanology, oceanography, soil and land management, agriculture, and limnology.

AVIRIS datasets are available at https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dataset_lister.pl?p=47.

## AVIRIS-C Datasets
The AVIRIS-C is an imaging spectrometer that delivers calibrated images of the upwelling spectral radiance in 224 contiguous spectral channels with wavelengths from 400 to 2500 nanometers (nm).

| [L2 Calibrated Reflectance, Facility Instrument Collection](https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/2154) |

## AVIRIS-NG Datasets
The AVIRIS-NG is the successor to AVIRIS-Classic and provides high signal-to-noise ratio imaging spectroscopy measurements in 425 contiguous spectral channels with wavelengths in the solar reflected spectral range (380-2510 nm) with 5 nm sampling. The AVIRIS-NG started operation in 2014 and is expected to replace the AVIRIS-C instrument.

## AVIRIS-3 Datasets
The AVIRIS-3 is the third of the AVIRIS spectrometer FI series and has higher signal-to-noise ratio performance than AVIRIS-C or AVIRIS-NG. The core spectrometer of AVIRIS-3 is an optically fast, F/1.8 Dyson imaging spectrometer spanning a wide width (39.5-degree field of view). The AVIRIS-3 provides measurements in 285 contiguous spectral channels with wavelengths in the solar reflected spectral range (390-2500 nm) with 7.4 nm sampling. The AVIRIS-3 started operation in 2023.

# HyTES
![](../img/hytes.png)

The Hyperspectral Thermal Emissions Spectrometer (HyTES) instrument has 512 pixels across track with pixel sizes in the range of 5 to 50 m depending on aircraft flying height and 256 spectral channels between 7.5 and 12 micrometer. 

HyTES started science flights in 2012. Since then HyTES has flown on Twin Otter aircraft from Twin Otter International and the British Antarctic Survey, [NASA ER-2](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/ER-2_-_AFRC) and [NASA Gulfstream V](httphttps://airbornescience.nasa.gov/aircraft/Gulfstream_V_-_JSC).

More information about HyTES and its data products are available here: https://hytes.jpl.nasa.gov/

## HyTES Data Products
